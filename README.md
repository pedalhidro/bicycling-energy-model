# bicycling-energy-model

A standalone, build-step-free study tool that compares two models of the
mechanical energy (and time) of pedalling a route:

- an **approximate** closed-form model — `E ≈ α·x + β·(h₊ − ε·h₋)` — the
  asymmetric uphill/downhill cycling-energy law used across the Pedal
  Hidrográfico tools (Simujaules / quilojaules);
- a **canonical** forward-dynamics simulation — a per-step force balance
  `m·dv/ds = k_eff·P/v − C_rr·mg·cosθ − ½ρ·CdA·(v+wind)² − mg·sinθ` with a
  safe-speed brake cap on descents (semi-implicit, so it stays exact even on
  near-stall climbs).

Both run on the **same physical constants**, so the difference isolates the
*modelling simplifications* (aero charged at a fixed flat speed, descent losses
lumped into ε, …) rather than a parameter mismatch.

## Use

Open **`applet/index.html`** in a browser — no build, no server, no
dependencies. You can:

- draw an elevation profile, or load a **GPX** or **FIT** file;
- from a FIT, auto-extract climb / flat / descent power (mean / median / mean-
  with-zeros, time-weighted, speed-gated) and derive the empirical descent
  recovery **ε** the ride exhibited;
- set per-regime power, climb/descent thresholds (incl. a "gravity ≥ 50%"
  button), headwind, and the engine resolution `dx`;
- compare total energy, the per-regime decomposition, the canonical speed
  profile, displacement energy, and the climb-aero correction (`off` / `≈0` /
  `v_c`) against canonical;
- read the **v2Edge** card — the per-edge realisation Simujaules actually
  deploys for routing (grade-local `ε(s)`, `k_s`, the coasting deficit `ε₀`; Entries 18–21),
  with its implied drop-weighted ε, the live dead-clamp readout, and a button
  applying Entry 21's Δx = 5 m re-calibrated trio. Its grade-local ε is
  resolution-sensitive: move the engine `dx` between 5 and 30 m on a real
  track to see the over-charge the journal measured.

## Independent verification (Python)

The whole workflow is also available in **pure Python**: the
`src/bicycling_energy_model/` package holds the engines/parsers, and
`research/journal/journal.qmd` is an executable Quarto mirror of the
research journal. While the port was being established, its equivalence to
the original JS engines was machine-checked by a JS parity harness (8 000+
values agreeing to float64 round-off); that check is now retired — the
Python package is the single implementation — and git history keeps it.

## Theory

**`research/notes/original_notes.md`** holds the derivations: the energy law and its `α`, `β`, `ε`
coefficients; the local recovery `ε(s)` and its descent-height-weighted
aggregate; the climb-aero over-charge correction; the time model
(effective-flat-distance `x* = x + k₊·h₊ − k₋·h₋`, with `k₊ = v_f·β/P_climb`
clean and `k₋` the time-domain twin of `ε`); and the `ε ↔ k₋` bridge through the
descent power.

## Data

`data/inputs/` — `sample.gpx` (tiny GPX fixture) and `flecha_power.csv` (per-second
power / altitude / grade / regime export from a long brevet, used for the
empirical-ε and statistics work; no GPS coordinates). Raw `*.fit` tracks, the
per-rider spreadsheets, and the downloaded activity dirs under `data/inputs/activities/`
are **gitignored** — they carry GPS tracks and private activity links. The
harnesses write their per-ride result CSVs to `data/results/` (also gitignored;
see `data/results/README.md` for the file → producer map).

The model has been validated against power-meter rides from **three riders** — the
author (44 long "longões" + 62 urban "censo" rides) plus **two independent riders**
(P. Paz, 441 rides; JAAM, 219 rides; neither a Pedal Hidrográfico member, each shared
with consent). Frozen and tested on the two independent riders, the energy law and the
coasting deficit ε₀ ≈ 0.13 transfer, while the geometric ε *skill* proves rider-dependent (it wins for
a coaster, is inconclusive for a fast descent-pedaller). The **time** model
(`x* = x + k₊·h₊ − k₋·h₋`) is also tested against measured moving time (`time_compare.py`):
the ascent half transfers, the descent bridge does not. The harnesses live in
`src/harness/` — all **Python, stdlib-only**, importing the engines from `src/bicycling_energy_model`
(`compare.py`, `censo_compare.py`, `eps_hypothesis.py`, `eps_sp_test.py`,
`ppaz_inventory.py`, `ppaz_compare.py`, `jaam_inventory.py`, `jaam_compare.py`,
`time_compare.py`, `regime_compare.py`, …) — and the write-ups — including the working
paper — live in **`research/`** (`MODEL_COMPARISON_JOURNAL.md`, `article-draft.md`, `literature-context.md`, …).
