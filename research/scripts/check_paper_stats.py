"""Cross-check the papers' claim annotations against the gate battery.

Every published statistic carries an invisible anchor at the number:

    reads **5.6% [5.2, 6.2]**<!--@c-pool34.f3d.med-->

and is described in a SIDECAR, <paper>.meta.ttl, in the project's existing RDF
vocabulary (schema:Claim, CiTO, PROV-O, Dublin Core) so paper claims COMPOSE with
research/notes/claims.ttl and research/data-graph.ttl instead of forming a
parallel vocabulary. The sidecar keeps the metadata out of prose that humans are
about to rewrite, inherits the repo's rule that every .ttl is rdflib-validated,
and survives the draft moving to a format where an HTML comment would not. A claim can cite the output that evidences it
(cito:citesAsEvidence dg:o_ppaz) and the journal assertion it descends from
(prov:wasDerivedFrom claims:assert12), which is the article-claim -> entry
traceability direction the journal deliverable (J.3) otherwise lacks.

WHAT THIS CHECKS
  1. every anchor has a claim and every claim has an anchor;
  2. pc:value is actually asserted in the gate section named by pc:gateSection —
     the audit that found four un-gated numbers in paper 1, as a command;
  3. dcterms:type is drawn from a closed vocabulary, so scope (calibration /
     in-sample / out-of-sample / external) is explicit AT THE POINT OF USE. That
     is the distinction reviewers said the framing blurs and the first thing a
     summariser loses;
  4. `planned` claims are reported, never failed — a scaffold honestly declaring
     what it does not yet have is correct, but a planned claim that never
     acquires a value is a promise the paper did not keep, so they stay visible.

Requires rdflib (the repo's usual TTL dependency). Exits non-zero on failure.
